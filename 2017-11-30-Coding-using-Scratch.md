In the past few weeks I have been learning to programme sprites on scratch, during which I have experimented with different options and different codes to making my sprite move successfully. Most recently I have started to make a replica of the retro 1980's  game Space Invaders. So far I have successfully been able to make the laser cannon at the bottom of the screen move and shoot, as well as making the alien boss be able to die and change costume to a number (e.g 50). In the near future I will be importing more sprites in an attempt to further complete the game. It will be a long process, but trust me...itâ€™s worth it.
