My target for my last lesson was to make  the aliens in my own space invaders game on scratch to move from left to right and down in synchronised action. It was mostly successful except I had a problem with some of the aliens being on top of eachother.          

I used persevering when some of my aliens were on top of eachother, so i had to play around with my code by using options like 'go to x…,go to y…' until my aliens weren’t on top of each other and moving correctly.

I used questioning by asking  myself questions like: what will happen to my sprite if i change the option 'go to x… go to y…'? I asked myself this question to try and get the sprites into separate places.

I used independence by trying to fix my problem of not being able to shoot my laser on my own by trying different options like 'move y…' rather than giving up and asking the teacher for the answer.

I used reflecting when I made the mistake of making my cloned sprites too slow.I reflected on it and figured out what I had done wrong which was putting the wrong number in the 'move … steps' option. Now I won’t make the same mistake again.

I used engagement when my shooting code didn't work. Instead of doing nothing and being lazy because my code didn’t work, I engaged,focused and tried on it and in the end figured out that I was missing the option 'change y by…’!

I could've focused more on my work(which would improve my progress) but a few times I was put off by failure. In the future I need to change my attitude to failure and persevere at all times and not just sometimes. I will do this by keep on playing with options for my code rather than just giving up!
